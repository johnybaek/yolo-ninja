## About

This project is my first attempt at using github for anything. I'm not trying to hide the fact that this is a learning experiment for me. My learning goal is to incorporate more coding into my daily practice. Working in a coding environment that is still user-friendly enough to my collaborators is a good starting point even if I'm not doing any coding per se. The environment also forces me to think in code rather than end products.

My first strategy is to manage common data collection from an open source community approach. By making the project available online, public, and forkable, I hope to decrease the limits to sharing and increase the adoption of definitions and tools that get developed along the way. All changes are open to inspection and not obscured by the editing platform. 

Why not use Google Docs? I love Google Docs, but the fact of the matter is that not everyone works in a Google environment. Therefore, this creates a barrier to sharing and collaborating which I'm trying to avoid. 

Why not use Google Sites? Two reasons. First, I'm lazy enough that I don't want to request IT to set up another Google Site account or ask to change the permission level on the site that I already have. Second, changes to the website are not tracked, so changes are very difficult to track. Plus, content editing is a bit of a pain. Oh, that's three.
