# Professional Development Programs

## Measures

*Output*: Number of educators who participated in NOAA-supported professional development programs that enhance understanding of NOAA-related topics and use of NOAA educational and scientific resources.

*Leading Outcome*: Percent of educators who intend to integrate what they learned in NOAA-supported professional development programs to educate others about NOAA-related topics or with NOAA educational and scientific resources.

*Lagging Outcome*: Percent of educators who integrated what they learned in NOAA-supported professional development programs to educate others about NOAA-related topics or with NOAA educational and scientific resources.

## Definitions

*Educators*: Those who facilitate learning in various roles: public school teachers, private or independent school teachers, informal educators, interpreters, volunteers serving as docents or educators, homeschool educators, or preservice teachers. 
* The number of educators is the cumulative number of participants in PD programs that were offered in the federal fiscal year. The performance measure reported is the sum of all Education Council member reported counts.
* Educators can be counted twice if they were present at two distinct professional development programs. Educators can be counted once per year for programs that occur over multiple years.
* Educators cannot be counted twice when there is one-to-one consultation or mentoring as a follow up to a professional development program.
* Educators should be counted as participants upon completion of the workshop, program or course, not just based on registration.

*Professional development programs*: An organized set of educational activities that are designed: 1) for educators as the primary target audience, 2) to enhance their knowledge and skills, and 3) to provide guidance on how to integrate knowledge, skills, and NOAA resources to educate others.
* Examples include all-day and multi-day workshops, teacher research experience programs, online courses, outdoor field experiences. Presentations at conferences should be reported if the intention of the presentation is to meet a professional development objective with respect to educational content or pedagogy--does not include presentations that just describe NOAA offerings or other marketing types of outreach activities. 

*NOAA-supported*: Report on all programs that are provided by NOAA staff or by partner institutions with a "substantial involvement" by NOAA. Substantial involvement includes funding, facilities, or staff time, in other words convened, coordinated, co-developed, funded, presented or co-presented by NOAA staff. Program content or design must involve NOAA-related science, NOAA data, or other NOAA assets.

*Intend to integrate*: The educator plans to deliver or use knowledge, skills or NOAA scientific or educational resources as part of their educational activities, instruction, curriculum or informal learning environments within a year of program completion.

*Integrated*: The delivery or use of knowledge, skills or resources as part of educational activities, instruction, curriculum or informal learning environments within a year of program completion. 
* Minimum level of use is one activity once for one group of learners. 
* Program design may include stipends and professional support to ensure use. 

*NOAA-related topics*: A set of knowledge and competencies about NOAA and disciplines that support NOAA's mission (ocean, coastal, Great Lakes, weather, and climate sciences). 

*NOAA resources*: Educational and scientific products and services that can be used in educational settings to educate others about NOAA and disciplines that support NOAA's mission (ocean, coastal, Great Lakes, weather, and climate sciences). 
* Examples of scientific products and services include scientific data, tools, websites, books, place-based learning areas, field sites, ships, aircraft, labs, or connections to NOAA scientists and other personnel.
* Examples of educational products and services include websites, curriculum, lesson plans, tools, games, books, field sites, exhibits, in-person and online programs, connections to NOAA educators.

## Disaggregations
*Educator Type*: The total number of educators disaggregated by the following categories: Elementary (grades K-5), Middle school (grades 6-8), High school (grades 9-12), Higher Education, Informal (informal learning environments), and Other. The Other category is provided in order to capture unique audiences that also participate in PD programs, examples include preschool, homeschool educators, preservice teachers, administrators, developers, parents, and scientists. 

*Institution Location*: The total number of educators disaggregated by the location of the educatorâ€™s school or work site. Locations are reported by U.S. State, U.S. Territory and International. 

## Program Attributes
*Strategic Plan Alignment*: The alignment of the program with objectives from the NOAA Education Strategic Plan. 
* NESP Objective 1.2. Formal and informal educators integrate ocean, coastal, Great Lakes, weather and climate sciences into their teaching, curricula and interpretive products and programs.
* NESP Objective 2.2. Formal and informal educators increase the integration of NOAA-related conservation and stewardship information in education programs, materials and curricula.
* NESP Objective 3.2. Formal and informal educators utilize and produce education materials and programs that integrate and promote consistent science-based messaging on hazards, impacts and societal challenges related to water, weather and climate.

## Data
*Administrative Records*: Each NOAA-supported professional development program is responsible for maintaining administrative records that document the number of participants for the lifetime of the program.

*Unified Data Call*: An annual collection of output measures, disaggregations, and outyear estimates data from each Education Council administrative unit.
* Data collected in the Unified Data Call is used for internal NOAA reporting, Annual Operating Plan (AOP) and Strategy Execution and Evaluation (SEE), and external reporting, NOAA Education Annual Accomplishments Report, Congressional and other leadership briefings. A few questions in the UDC are used for internal quality control purposes, to verify data quality. 
* B-WET Exception: Since NERRS and SG can be grantees of BWET and ELG grant programs, there will likely be some double-counting of data reported. Whenever possible, both the grantees and the grant programs should report their numbers and provide additional detail on how much comes from grants awarded to NERRS, SG and other Education Council administrative units.  

*Outcome Measure Data Collection Form*: An annual collection of outcome measure data from each Education Council administrative unit.
* Data collected includes: 1) number of participants, 2) number of responses, 3) number for each response option, 4) type of data collection, and 5) copy of data collection instrument.

*Participant Survey*: A structured set of questions and response options used to collect information about participants and their thoughts and perceptions in relation to elements of the program. 
* For lagging outcomes, collect and report data on programs implemented in the prior federal fiscal year. The period of time following program completion can be a maximum of one year, this will vary by program and depends on the program theory. Three and six-month intervals are common. PRA clearance are needed for programs delivered by NOAA staff. For additional guidance see footnote 1.
* Standardized items should be embedded as part of an existing instrument or can be asked on their own. See best practices: Developing a new survey.
* Collect responses from all participants--or as many as possible. See best practices: Getting a good response rate.

*Standardized Item #1*: Modify question and response option text in the [square brackets] as needed based on the program content and design 2.
